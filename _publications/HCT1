<b>Abstract:</b> 

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) survivors are burdened by a high prevalence and early onset of
chronic diseases. Healthy dietary patterns have been associated with lower risks of chronic health conditions in the
general population. HCT survivors are susceptible to multiple complications thatmay result in chronic illness. Unfortunately,
no study to date has comprehensively documented the adherence of HCT survivors to the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans (DGA), which are designed specifically to provide guidance for making healthy food choices. The
primary aim of this study was to evaluate diet quality and nutrient intake adequacy of HCT survivors. A secondary
aim was to assess these survivors’ willingness to take part in a future dietary intervention. The dietary intake of
adults who had undergone autologous or allogeneic HCT for a hematologic disease and were at least 1 year posttransplantation
was assessed using the Block 2014 food frequency questionnaire, and diet quality was estimated
using the Healthy Eating Index 2015. Nutrient intake adequacies of the group were estimated by the estimated average
requirement cutpoint method. Survivors’ (n = 90) HEI-2015 scores averaged 61.6 § 1.1. Adherence to a goodquality
diet was reported by only 10% of survivors. Intakes of vitamins A, C, and D, as well as magnesium and calcium,
suggested inadequacy. Fiber intake at 8.9 g per 1000 kcal/day fell below the recommended adequate intake.
“Change in taste” was associated with lower quality of diet (P = .02). HCT survivors within 2 years post-transplantation
were more receptive than survivors beyond 2 years to participating in a dietary intervention (95% versus 65%;
P = .0013). Adult HCT survivors reported less-than-optimal adherence to the 2015-2020 DGA and had numerous
shortfall nutrient intakes; however, their willingness to participate in a dietary intervention was relatively high.
These findings reinforce the need to incorporate nutrition into HCT survivor care.
