<b>Intro:</b> 
Long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) survivors are burdened by a high prevalence and early onset of chronic diseases. Healthy dietary patterns have been associated with lower risks of chronic health conditions in the general population, yet no study to date has comprehensively documented the adherence of HCT survivors to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), specifically designed to provide guidance for making healthy food choices. The aims of this study were to evaluate the extent to which HCT survivors adhere to the DGA and to determine nutrient intake adequacy. A secondary aim was to assess their willingness to take part in a future nutritional program or dietary intervention.
