Welcome to my page! My name is Shalini (SHAH-lynn-ee) Nair. I earned my <a href="https://undergrad.phhp.ufl.edu/program-overview/bph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bachelor of Public Health </a> at the University of Florida, where I gained three years of research experience, primarily addressing cancer epidemiology and transplant outcomes. I completed an <a href="https://mph.ufl.edu/about/mph/collaborative-and-joint-mph-degrees/combination-bachelors-mph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">advanced track combined degree program </a>, where I began coursework towards a graduate degree during the third year of my undergraduate career. Currently, I am finishing my <a href="https://mph.ufl.edu/about/concentration-options/epidemiology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at UF </a>, with an expected graduation date of May 2021. In addition to my research, my graduate curriculum has given me a strong foundation in data analysis in SAS and R. The majority of my graduate electives have focused on the dynamics and epidemiology of infectious diseases. Relevant coursework include Virology, Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Epidemiology Methods I and II, and Public Health Computing.   
  
I am particularly fascinated by emerging pathogens and the complex factors associated with their development and spread. I plan on pursuing a doctoral degree, with a focus on the use of quantitative modeling methods to inform public health response to infectious disease outbreaks.
