**ABOUT**  
  
I earned my Bachelor of Public Health at the University of Florida, where my undergraduate research primarily focused on cancer epidemiology and transplant outcomes. I completed an advanced track combined degree program, where I began coursework towards a graduate degree during the third year of my undergraduate career. Currently, I am finishing my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at UF, with an expected graduation date of May 2021. I plan on pursuing doctoral study in epidemiology, with a focus on the dynamics of infectious disease transmission.
