Welcome to my page! My name is Shalini (SHAH-lynn-ee) Nair. I earned my <a href="https://undergrad.phhp.ufl.edu/program-overview/bph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bachelor of Public Health </a> at the University of Florida, where my undergraduate research primarily focused on cancer epidemiology and transplant outcomes. I completed an <a href="https://mph.ufl.edu/about/mph/collaborative-and-joint-mph-degrees/combination-bachelors-mph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">advanced track combined degree program </a>, where I began coursework towards a graduate degree during the third year of my undergraduate career. Currently, I am finishing my <a href="https://mph.ufl.edu/about/concentration-options/epidemiology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at UF </a>, with an expected graduation date of May 2021. I plan on pursuing a doctoral degree, with a focus on the use of quantitative modeling methods to inform public health response to infectious disease outbreaks. 

## <span style="color:darkblue">Background</span> 

During my undergraduate study, I was a two-time recipient of the <a href="https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/university-scholars-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">University Scholars Award </a>â€”a prestigious fellowship funding mentored research. The first year funded work with Dr. Laura Guyer where we assessed career readiness outcomes in pre-health students across the state of Florida. Specifically, we investigated whether participation in the extracurricular program Health Occupation Students of American (HOSA) prepared a future workforce capable of meeting the ever-changing needs of diverse populations.  

The second year funded my work with Dr. Nosha Farhadfar through the UF Health Cancer Center. I was able to expand my experience into the clinical setting at the UF Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic where I consented and surveyed patients, conducted follow-ups, and managed data integrity helping to address dietary outcomes in transplant patients. This experience culminated in a talk, a poster presentation, a publication, and a supplement. Building off of my work here, I then transitioned into a <a href="https://moffitt.org/education/research-education-and-training/office-of-undergraduate-and-visiting-scholar-affairs/formal-programs/spark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">summer internship </a> in Cancer Epidemiology with Dr. Jong Park at Moffitt Cancer Center.   

Finally, I most recently worked as a data specialist under Dr. Debra Kelly in the Department of Biobehavioral Nursing Science at the UF College of Nursing. I worked closely with Dr. Kelly during my previous experience at the Cancer Center and was recruited to continue with her as a paid assistant on three of her protocols. I gained immense experience with data management using both OnCore and REDCap interfaces, as well as with navigating the electronic health record EPIC.  

In addition to my research, my graduate curriculum has given me a strong foundation in data analysis in SAS and R. The majority of my graduate electives have focused on the dynamics and epidemiology of infectious diseases. Relevant coursework include Virology, Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Epidemiology Methods I and II, and Public Health Computing. I am particularly fascinated by emerging pathogens and the complex factors associated with their development and spread. The application of quantitative modeling methods to this dynamic is a forefront that I would like to pivot to explore during my doctoral studies.
