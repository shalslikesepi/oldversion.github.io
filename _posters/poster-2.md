**ABSTRACT**   
This research study analyzes the multifactorial relationship between participation in vocational preparation program Health Occupation Students of America (HOSA) and students’ perceived readiness to enter various fields of health. As a division under the Florida Department of Education, HOSA’s primary aims involve (1) promoting interest in health careers and (2) enhancing the delivery of quality health care to all people. A comprehensive survey addressing aspects of family background, demographics, and preparedness/perception of entering the field of health was distributed to all chapters of Florida HOSA via online platform Qualtrics. Over 15,000 student members of HOSA were invited to participate and at the end of data collection approximately 400 completed surveys were analyzed. The major limitation of this study was the low response rate (2.7%). Results proved the program to be highly effective with 90% of students feeling prepared to enter the field of health. However, when it came to assessing students’ awareness of concepts such as cultural competence, answers were far more scattered---suggesting a potential gap in real world application of program knowledge. While the results did not yield statistically relevant findings, results may serve as a foundational basis for evaluating the effectiveness of similar programs.
